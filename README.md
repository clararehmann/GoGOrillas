# GoGOrillas

[GOrilla](https://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/) is a useful gene ontology analysis tool that you can access using a web browser. 
This repo contains `lynx` scripts and accessories in order to run GOrilla from the command line, download XLS files with results, and convert them to TSV format.
